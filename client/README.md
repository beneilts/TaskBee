# TaskBee

TaskBee is a web tool for managing tasks and projects, similar to Trello. It was built using React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL, and uses Nhost for authentication.

**NOTE:** *This project is still in progress so not all features have been implemented yet.*

## Features

- Create boards for different projects
- Add and remove columns for each board
- Add and remove tasks within each column
- Drag and drop tasks between columns
- Assign tasks to specific users
- View tasks assigned to you across all boards
- Authenticate users using Nhost

## Tech Stack

- React: Front-end library for building user interfaces
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system
- GraphQL: A query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to REST
- Nhost: A serverless backend platform that provides authentication, database, and API services

## Getting Started

To get started with TaskBee, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using npm install.
3. Start the development server using npm start.

You will also need to set up a Nhost account and configure your API keys for authentication. See the [Nhost documentation](https://docs.nhost.io/quickstarts/react) for more information.
